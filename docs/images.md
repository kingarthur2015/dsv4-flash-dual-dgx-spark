# Container Images

This document describes the container image tags used by this repository and
how they relate to runtime presets and Git history.

The top-level README only lists the current recommended runtime paths. This
document provides the detailed image-tag history.

## Current recommended paths

| Path | Status | Config | Image source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dsv4-d568` | Frozen primary DeepSeek-V4-Flash baseline | `presets/dsv4-flash-fp8-tp2.env` | `ghcr.io/bjk110/vllm-spark:dsv4-d568` — see the image mapping below |
| `unholy-fusion` | Experimental high-prefill path | `.env.unholy-fusion` + `compose/docker-compose.unholy.yml` | External/upstream image (`aidendle94/sparkrun-vllm-ds4-gb10:production-ready`) or its GHCR mirror — see [`docs/unholy-fusion-benchmark.md`](unholy-fusion-benchmark.md) |

## Image tag mapping

GHCR image tags (`ghcr.io/bjk110/vllm-spark:<tag>`) and Git tags do **not**
march in lockstep yet — only `v018-ngc2603` exists as a Git tag. The mapping
below documents what each image tag corresponds to in the Git history. Use
this table when you need to reproduce or roll back to a specific image.

| Image tag | Git ref (commit) | Stack | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dsv4-d568` (active, DSV4-specific) | repository HEAD at the time this mapping was last reviewed | `FROM v022-d568` + SM12x DSV4 vLLM patches | DeepSeek-V4-Flash primary path; used only by `presets/dsv4-flash-fp8-tp2.env`. See [`docs/dsv4-flash-tp2.md`](dsv4-flash-tp2.md). **Frozen.** |
| `v022-d568` (active, general base) | repository HEAD at the time this mapping was last reviewed | NGC 26.04 + vLLM 0.21.0+PR#35568 + FlashInfer 0.6.11.post3 + Triton 3.7.0 + NCCL 2.30.4 + Transformers 5.8.1 | Forward-stack validation base for v022-series presets and the dsv4-d568 derivative. |
| `v021-tq` | `3070f9a` | base + TQ patches + Inductor-graph-partition fix | Required for any `*-tq.env` preset (legacy preset base for TurboQuant presets). |
| `v021-ngc2603` | `8623187` | vLLM `95995bbe` + FlashInfer `v0.6.9` | Retained for older presets — most non-TQ `presets/*.env` files reference this. |
| `v020-ngc2603` (superseded) | `8efdf0b` (base-refresh-20260417 base bump) | vLLM `978a4462` + FlashInfer `v0.6.8` | Superseded by v021; only kept on GHCR for historical reproduction. |
| `v019-ngc2603` (superseded) | `7736716` (Gemma 4 + vLLM 0.19.1 upgrade) | vLLM `0.19.1` `a7d79fa` + FlashInfer `v0.6.7.post3` | Superseded by v021. |
| `v018-ngc2603` (archive) | `feb5993` (NGC 26.03 source build intro) — Git tag `v018-ngc2603` exists | vLLM `0.18.3` `c494977` + FlashInfer `v0.6.7` | The only currently-tagged release in Git. |

## Notes

- GHCR image tags and Git tags may not always move in lockstep.
- Prefer release notes and image digests when exact image reproducibility
  matters — see this repository's GitHub Releases for independently verified
  digests.
- Some older tags are retained for historical reproduction only.
- Do not infer current recommended runtime settings from raw image tags alone.
- For maintainer-only Git tag creation and archived branch notes, see
  [`docs/release-management.md`](release-management.md).
