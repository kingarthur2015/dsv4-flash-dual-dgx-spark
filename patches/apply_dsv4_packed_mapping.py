"""Add packed_modules_mapping to DeepseekV4ForCausalLM.

Without this 1-line shim, FP8_BLOCK on attn fails when loading
pastapaul/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-W4A16-FP8 (or any compressed-tensors W4A16
DSV4 build) with:

    ValueError: Unable to find matching target for
    model.layers.0.attn.fused_wqa_wkv in the compressed-tensors config.

kylesayrs's PR #41276 references `self.packed_modules_mapping` (line 205)
but does not define it on the class — that's what this patch supplies.
